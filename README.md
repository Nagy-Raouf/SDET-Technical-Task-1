## About the Project

This project serves as a basic automation testing suite built with Nightwatch.js. The purpose is to demonstrate a foundational approach to end-to-end testing.

The tests are built using the **Nightwatch.js** framework and follow the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern. The POM separates the UI elements and interactions from the test logic, making the tests more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain. We use a local **Selenium WebDriver** for running tests on Chrome.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run these tests, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher is recommended. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: This comes bundled with Node.js.
- **Git**: You will need this to clone the repository.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nagy-Raouf/SDET-Technical-Task-1.git
    cd SDET-Technical-Task-1
    ```
2.  **Install the npm packages** specified in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm install --save-dev
    ```

### Configuration

The main configuration file is **`nightwatch.conf.js`**. You can modify this file to adjust settings such as `src_folders` (the directory where your test files are located) and `test_settings` (which define different test environments, like `chrome` or `firefox`).

## Running the Test

Here's how you can execute the test suite.
